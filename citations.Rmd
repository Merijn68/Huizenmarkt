## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# References

A nice line is also fine

This is normal text. If we want to indent a paragraph we could change the size of the left margin:



```{r}

library(tidyverse)

# Export Citations as Bibtex (.bib)
knitr::write_bib(file="Bibliography of packages.bib")

# Table (.csv) with all information on the packages
appendix_packages <- data.frame(Packagename = character(),
                                Version = character(),
                                Maintainer = character())

require(pacman)
for (pkg in p_loaded()){
  appendix_packages <- appendix_packages %>% 
    add_row(
    Packagename = pkg,
    Version = as.character(packageVersion(pkg)),
    Maintainer = maintainer(pkg)
  )
}

write.csv(x = appendix_packages, file = "List_of_packages.csv", row.names = F)
```
::: {.hanging-indent}
This paragraph should have hanging indentation. pandoc uses this format automatically for reference section items if instructed by a .csl style file to do so. Why is this not carried forward to the bibliografy???
